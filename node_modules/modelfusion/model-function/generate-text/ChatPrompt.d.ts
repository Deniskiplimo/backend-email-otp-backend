/**
 * A chat prompt is a sequence of messages with the following structure:
 *
 * - A chat prompt can optionally start with a system message.
 * - After the optional system message, the first message of the chat must be a user message.
 * - Then it must be alternating between an ai message and a user message.
 * - The last message must always be a user message.
 *
 * The type checking is done at runtime, because there a no good ways to do it statically.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * [
 *   { system: "You are a celebrated poet." },
 *   { user: "Write a short story about a robot learning to love." },
 *   { ai: "Once upon a time, there was a robot who learned to love." },
 *   { user: "That's a great start!" },
 *  ]
 * ```
