Transcribed audio:
"Wow, that was an incredible performance! Your voice really made me feel like I was at the concert. Can you please tell me more about the song? Maybe what instruments were used or the chorus section?"

Response:
Of course! The song is called "Hallelujah," and it's a classic from Leonard Cohen. The song starts with a simple piano melody, and then the band joins in on guitar, bass, drums, and violin. The chorus section consists of a repeating refrain that repeats three times:

- Hallelujah, hallelujah,
- Hallelujah, hallelujah,
- Hallelujah, hallelujah.

Overall, the song is a great example of how to use different instruments and structures in a vocal performance. I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
